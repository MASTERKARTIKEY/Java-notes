☕ JVM: Java Virtual Machine
What it does: The JVM is like a virtual computer that runs your Java programs.

It converts compiled Java bytecode (.class files) into machine code that your hardware can understand.

It handles:

Memory management

Garbage collection

Threading

Security

➡️ Think of JVM as the engine that actually executes your Java code.

📦 JRE: Java Runtime Environment
What it includes: The JRE contains the JVM plus core libraries and class files needed to run Java applications.

It’s what you install if you want to run Java apps, but not develop them.

➡️ If JVM is the engine, JRE is the whole car needed to drive a Java application.

🛠️ JDK: Java Development Kit
What it includes: The JDK is a complete toolkit for Java developers. It contains:

The JRE (so it includes JVM and core libraries)

Compiler (javac)

Debugger

JavaDoc

Other development tools

➡️ It's everything you need to create and build Java programs.

Component	  Purpose	                             Contains
JVM	      Executes Java bytecode	                 Core part of JRE
JRE	      Runs Java apps	                         JVM + Standard Libraries
JDK	      Develops Java programs	                 JRE + Tools & Compiler

🧠 Memory Management 

Java automatically handles memory for your program so you don’t have to manually manage it like in C or C++.

When you create variables or objects, Java stores them in memory.

It divides memory mainly into:

Stack – for simple variables and function calls.

Heap – for objects and dynamic data.

➡️ Think of Java memory as a smart storage shelf—Java puts things where they belong and keeps track so you don’t lose them.

🗑️ Garbage Collection
When your program no longer needs an object, Java cleans it up for you.

The Garbage Collector finds unused objects and removes them from memory.

This prevents memory leaks and keeps your program running smoothly.

➡️ Imagine a robotic cleaner inside your code that tosses out unused stuff automatically!

🧵 Threading
Java can run multiple tasks at the same time using threads.

Each thread is like a worker doing a job.

Multithreading lets your app be fast and responsive (e.g., loading images while playing music).

➡️ Think of threading like a kitchen where multiple chefs (threads) are cooking different parts of the meal—all together!

🔐 Security
Java has built-in tools to protect your code from bad behavior or attacks.

Sandboxing: Keeps code running in a safe environment.

ClassLoader: Controls which classes are allowed to load.

Bytecode verification: Makes sure no suspicious instructions sneak into your program.

➡️ Java’s like a guarded castle—only trusted code gets inside, and shady behavior gets blocked.

🏃 Behind the Scenes: Java Execution Flow
Your Java code goes through several steps before it finally runs on your machine:

You write the code → in a .java file (like Game.java)

Compiler (javac) turns it into bytecode → creates a .class file — this is not human-readable but not quite machine language either.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) executes the bytecode → The JVM runs inside your computer, interpreting or just-in-time compiling the bytecode into machine code that your CPU understands.

🧭 Where Does It Actually Run?
Layer	                 Description
Source Code	       .java files you write
Bytecode	         .class files compiled by javac
JVM	Runs           the bytecode on your hardware
OS & CPU	         JVM communicates with your operating system and processor to run instructions
So your code ultimately runs on your physical computer (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.), but it’s processed through the JVM—which acts as a translator.

⚙️ Why This Setup Rocks
Portability: Your code can run on any device with a JVM. "Write once, run anywhere" ✅

Security: The JVM acts as a sandbox, keeping your app isolated and safe.

Optimization: Java can use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to speed things up at runtime.
